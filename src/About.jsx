    return <p>My name is Sadiya Zareen, I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science
    from BMSCE, Bangalore. I now work as a Software Engineer at HCL Technologies.
    I like to socialize more through experiences I have learned to interact with a 
    diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others..
    People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with 
    good communication skills. I am detailed oriented that allows me to be
    a strength to myself.
